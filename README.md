## Machine Learning Assignment

#### Instructions
Follow the instructions in question carefully.
A Jupyter notebook along with the output for each cell is expected. Please do not submit zip or rar files.
Any assignment submitted using other python IDEs are not considered for grading.
 

#### Problem Statement:

Attached is a dataset that shows the flower classification ML problem. The task is to predict the class of the plant-based on certain features given in the excel file. The xlsx has 2 components one showing the variables data and another file showing the explanation of what each of these variables means.

For this problem, ignore the problem metrics. Ignore the units of tree length like mm or cm. For e.g. do not think that the tree length is in mm or cm. All the measures are metric-less (unit less) and for this problem treat each column in that capacity.

### For the dataset, implement the Linear SVM classifier using Python. [6M]

#### The marks distribution is as follows

* Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1M]
* Split features and labels [0.5M]
* Split train and test data [0.5M}
* Implement Linear SVM Classifier [2M]
* Calculate accuracy measures [1.5M]
 

### For the same dataset, implement classification Kernel SVM using Python. [6M]

#### The marks distribution is as follows

* Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1M]
* Split features and labels [0.5M]
* Split train and test data [0.5M}
* Implement Kernel SVMClassifier [2M]
* Calculate accuracy measures [1.5M]
 

* Compare the results and accuracies for both the algorithms and share your inferences. [1M]
